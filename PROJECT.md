## Project Details

Let’s pretend you’re a small business owner who has just set up a new Shopify store and installed Smile. You’ve decided to create a standalone web-app (separate from your Shopify store) focused on showcasing your rewards program. This web app will make use of **Smile’s JavaScript SDK (Smile.js)** as well as **Smile’s Backend API** to power its functionality.

---

### ✅ General Requirements

- The app’s code must be hosted in a **GitHub repository**, and the following users must be given read access:
  - `lucasprag` (Lucas)
  - `andrewpye` (Andy)
  - `michellecolin` (Michelle)

- Any scaffolded/boilerplate/framework code should be committed to the **main branch**. The code you write/customize for the project should be available in a **separate branch**. Submit your work via a **Pull Request**.

- You can use any language/framework (Smile prefers **Ruby for backend** and **React for frontend**), but:
  - Your app must make backend API calls using a **private API token**
  - The token **must never be exposed to the client**

- The app must be **deployed** and publicly accessible on the internet.
  - Smile will reimburse **$25 CAD** for any hosting costs (no receipt submission needed)

- Smile.js should be **initialized on the page** using your Smile account details and authenticated as the **sample customer** (details below)

- **No authentication/login system** is required

- The app should be **standalone**, not embedded in or part of your Shopify store

### 🧠 Things to Keep in Mind

This isn’t a production-level app, but we want to see **production-level thinking**:

- Clear and thoughtful **code structure**
- Good **separation of concerns**
- **Secure handling** of data

Make sure all core features work as described and align with both the **intent** and **expected behavior**.

---

### 🎟️ Feature: Redeeming for a Reward

- The homepage should:
  - Display the **customer’s current points balance**
  - Show a **list of available redemption options**
    - Indicate whether the customer has enough points to redeem each option

- Clicking a reward should:
  - Redeem points
  - Display the **coupon code** to the customer

---

### 🧮 Feature: Math Question

- The homepage should show a **simple math question** (e.g., `5 + 5`)
  - The numbers should be **randomized** on every page load

- Correct answers should:
  - **Reward 50 points** to the customer

---

### 💰 Feature: Manual Points Issuing

- When viewing the app with the query param `?admin=true`, show a **button** to:
  - Add or remove an arbitrary number of points

- After modification:
  - Display a **confirmation message**
  - Refresh and display the updated **points balance**

---

### 💡 Tips

- Smile’s **Developer Hub** contains all technical documentation:
  - The **Fundamentals** section is particularly helpful
  - Help docs cover less technical details (e.g., where to find API keys)

- Choose between **Smile.js** and the **Backend API** for each feature depending on what's most appropriate

- Your **deployment setup** won’t be evaluated—use what you’re comfortable with

- Think of this as an **MVP**. If you make intentional trade-offs, **note them in your PR**

---

### 💬 Communication

- Ask questions & give status updates in the **Slack channel**
- Core working hours: **9 AM – 5 PM ET, Mon–Fri**
- Feel free to post in the channel any time—notifications are quiet outside hours

#### When finished:

1. Open a **PR** for your project branch
2. Include:
   - A **live link** to the deployed app
   - A **disclaimer** on AI tool usage (e.g., Copilot is fine, just don’t outsource the whole thing to Claude)
3. Tag:
   - `@lucasprag`
   - `@andrewpye`
   - `@michellecolin`
4. Notify the team in Slack

After review, we’ll schedule time to chat and give feedback.

### 🛒 Your Shopify Store

- **Admin URL:** [http://marc-andre-smile.myshopify.com/admin](http://marc-andre-smile.myshopify.com/admin)
- **Frontend URL:** [http://marc-andre-smile.myshopify.com/](http://marc-andre-smile.myshopify.com/)
- **Store Frontend Password:** `smile`

---

### 🙂 Your Smile Account

- In your Shopify Admin, click **Apps** > **Smile.io**
- This is referred to as **“Smile Admin”** (where you manage your rewards program)

---

### 🛍️ Sample Customer (For Logged-In State)

1. Visit your Shopify store frontend
2. Go to the **login page**
3. Use your email to request a **magic link** and login
4. Click **“Go to store”** in the top-right corner
5. You should see a floating **“Rewards” button**
   - Click it to view a **zero-point balance**
   - This creates a new customer in both Shopify and Smile

Use this **customer** for the logged-in state in your standalone app.
